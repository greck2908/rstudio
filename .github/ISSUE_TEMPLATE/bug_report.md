<!--

RStudio v1.2 is now available for download at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. If you're currently using an older version of RStudio, we would appreciate it if you could update to RStudio v1.2 and confirm whether the problem still persists.

This issue tracker is for bugs and feature requests in the RStudio IDE. If you're having trouble with R itself or an R package, see https://www.r-project.org/help.html, and if you want to ask a question rather than report a bug, go to https://community.rstudio.com/. Finally, if you use RStudio Server Pro, get in touch with our Pro support team at support@rstudio.com.

See our guide to writing good bug reports for more details: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Bug-Reports
